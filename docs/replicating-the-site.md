## How to replicate the project

Clearly you could just fork our project, copy the spreadsheet mentioned below and go on your merry way, but we hope that you would like to work together so that we can jointly continue to develop this project and both end up benefiting from all future development.

### Get in touch

Please do get in touch with us, we'd love to chat with you to discuss how we can best work together. From a technical perspective it's probably best to first chat with [Maeva Fincker](https://github.com/mfincker) who is currently the lead developer on this project. 

## Project Structure

Our site is currently a VueJS website (think frontend code) backed by JSON data that is pulled from a Google Spreadsheet.

### Data source - Google Spreadsheet

Our current data source for the site is a Google Spreadsheet, the following link [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SOUonPM40Si4LrPoGrkUnujbmLBxCQe1SdxydH2dVI4/edit?usp=sharing) is this database so that you can utilize this data for your own needs. 

### Frontend Code

- VueJS - The Progressive JavaScript Framework - https://vuejs.org/
- Vue I18n - Internationalization Plugin - https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/
- Vue Leaflet - Mapping - ( Version of Leaflet that works with VueJS ) - https://vue2-leaflet.netlify.com/
- BootstrapVue - Responsive Layout - ( Version of Bootstrap that works well with VueJS ) - https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/

## Current Hosting

The Bay Area Mega Map website is currently hosted as a GitHub Pages site, however this may well change as we are intending to add a "back end".
