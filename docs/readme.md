## This project is

- A mobile-friendly website with an interactive map and table of local resources.
- A tool to help our communities and neighbors navigate the COVID crisis.
- A collaborative effort connected to local officials and support organizations.
- An open project that can be quickly adapted to other locations & future needs.

## The types of resource questions we want to answer

- Where can I find a free meal?
- Where can I find a market with senior/vulnerable shopping hours?
- Where can I find a market that takes SNAP and WIC benefits?
- Where can I get legal assistance for eviction?
- Where can I find a medical provider while I'm uninsured?

## Authors

This project was initiated by students affiliated with Stanford's [Data Challenge Lab](https://datalab.stanford.edu/challenge-lab) with input from local officials and community organizations across the Bay Area. This project is a fork of [NC COVID Support](https://nccovidsupport.org/), thank you Chris and Kate for your ongoing support.

## How to contribute

There are two areas we need help, one is with the ongoing software development of this project and the other is with the task of collating and adding accurate up to date data for the site.

### Contribution to the project code

It is great that you are interested in helping to contribute to our project, please take a look at our [How to Contribute](contributing.md) page for more details.

### Become a Content Editor

We are always looking for people to join our content data team, as our site grows in popularity so does the number of listings that we need to manage. For more information visit out [Content Editors](content-editors.md) page.

## Replicating the project

When we first started this project, we hoped that other areas would be interested in replicating our site for their area and working together to build an even better platform. Visit our [Replicating the site](replicating-the-site.md) page for more information.
