## This project is

* A mobile-friendly website with an interactive map and table of local resources.
* A tool to help our communities and neighbors navigate the COVID crisis.
* A collaborative effort connected to local officials and support organizations.
* An open project that can be quickly adapted to other locations & future needs.

## The types of resource questions we want to answer

* Where can I find a free meal?
* Where can I find free diapers/toilet paper/personal care items?
* Where can I find a drive-up pharmacy?
* Where can I find a market with senior/vulnerable shopping hours?
* Where can I find a pet store with a drive-up option?
* Which businesses offer discounts for medical workers?
